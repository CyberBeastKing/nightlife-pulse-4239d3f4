## Chat Moderation
- 3-strike system with warning notifications
- AI + human content moderation
- Inappropriate content leads to chat room bans
- Rate limiting on messages

## Anti-Abuse Measures
- Report users/chats functionality needed
- Location obfuscation for individuals
- Fake signal detection (critical unsolved problem)

## Small Venue Protection
- Minimum thresholds before showing numbers
- Below threshold shows "Quiet" instead of exact count (e.g., "2 people")
- Prevents "dead signal spiral" that kills small venues
- Use fuzzy crowd counts ("8-12 people") for privacy

## Trust Principles
- Hawkly is place-centric, not person-centric
- No friend activity feeds pushing FOMO
- Anti-influencer, anti-curation stance
- Restraint and neutrality as core values
